# Project-2
This project is a simple to-do list application implemented in C++ using various data structures and algorithms (DSA) concepts. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, removing, marking tasks as completed, listing tasks, and undoing the last operation. It features a menu-driven interface for easy interaction.
